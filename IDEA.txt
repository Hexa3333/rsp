The bot is multithreaded:
  +1 thread is used for responding to people automatically
  +1 thread is used for the programmer to use manually

  + The bot reads from a file, named {username}.rsp, and if the users name is called for
the first time, it runs the indexing algorithm. Then a random string (wrapped around "")
is returned as a string according to the requested token.

  + Global file (global.rsp) for replying generally.

  .rsp format example:
[]
# cunku blabla bla
"funny sex guy arrived"
"patron geldi"
"anal time"

[sa]
"as kardes"

[allah yok]:
"arastirmani oneririm"
