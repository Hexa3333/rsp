The bot is multithreaded:
  +1 thread is used for responding to people automatically
  +1 thread is used for the programmer to use manually

  + The bot reads from a file, named {username}.rsp, (if the users name is called for
the first time, it runs the indexing algorithm) then a random string (wrapped around "")
is dynamically read as a string according to the header. (Only supports single lines for now)

  + Global file (global.rsp) for replying generally.

  .rsp format example:
[]
# because bla bla
"replymaxxing"
"whatever you say"

[hello]
"hello"

[bots are gay]:
"No u"


TERMINOLOGY:
.rsp - A big text file that is to be analysed and index mapped.
head - Text wrapped around brackets that are basically trigger words
